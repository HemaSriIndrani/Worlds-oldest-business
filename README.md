Project: # Worlds-oldest-business for DBMS 5th sem course. 

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.

BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company that is still in business in (almost) every country and compiled the results into a dataset. In this project, you'll explore that dataset to see what they found.

Learning outcomes of the project

• Used SQL to discover the businesses that survived the changing market conditions for more than thousands of
years.
• Joining techniques have been used to merge the useful data since the acquired data has been derived from various
datasets.
• Data Manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering were used to count oldest businesses by continents and
categories.
